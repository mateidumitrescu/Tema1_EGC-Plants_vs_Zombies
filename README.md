### Dumitrescu Rares Matei 331CA

The idea of the game comes from the very known "Plants VS Zombies" game, except that this time it is "Rhombuses VS Hexagons".

The player has to choose between 4 types of Rhombuses in top bar of the game (orange, blue, yellow, purple). Those have different costs (1 star, 2 stars, 2 stars, 3 stars).

The player will have 9 slots to place the Rhombuses in order to shoot the Hexagons. Only Rhombuses with the same color of the enemy that is coming on the same line can shoot that enemy:
#### Example: orange Rhombus will shoot orange Hexagon.

There will be randomly generated stars on screen every 3 seconds and the game will not generate more than 5 stars on the screen if the player does not pick them up.

The bonus stars on the ground that the player will pick will show up on right top side of screen and will use them to buy Rhombuses.

When a Hexagon reaches left side of the screen (called it barrier in code) the player loses one life. At 3 lost lives, the game is lost.
